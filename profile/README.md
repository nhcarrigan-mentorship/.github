Hey there! 👋 I'm **Naomi** — a transfem software engineer, community manager, and (failed) VTuber who's passionate about building inclusive tech communities and breaking down barriers in the industry. I am the founder of [NHCarrigan](https://nhcarrigan.com), and one of the pro-bono services we offer is a self-guided mentorship programme!

## What is the programme?

This is a self-guided programme where you build your resume-worthy "flagship" project - following our structured approach for product management and ensuring your work aligns with your goals.

Most of the collaboration is coordinated through [our Discord community](https://chat.nhcarrigan.com), so participants are required to join and engage there!

## How do I join?

Join the [Discord community](https://chat.nhcarrigan.com) and select the mentorship role as part of your onboarding. Or, if you are already a member, select the role through the `Channels and Roles` tab.

Once you have the role, my assistant Amari will ping you with your next steps.

## Do I need to have experience?

Nope! **The primary purpose of this event is to facilitate learning.** We won't deny people for having not learned things! That would defeat the point.

## I have more questions, Naomi!

Awesome! I love answering questions! First, you should totally [check out the mentorship wiki](https://docs.nhcarrigan.com/mentorship/00-faq/). We worked really hard on it, and there's a lot of information there!

If that doesn't answer your questions, pop in to the [Discord community](https://chat.nhcarrigan.com) and ping me! 

## Want to get to know Naomi?

[The NHCarrigan Discord community](https://chat.nhcarrigan.com) is the perfect place to connect with us on a more personal level!
